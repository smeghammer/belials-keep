NOTES:

 - Make a slaughtermap area that eventually exposes a switch to raise the 3D sector thtat allows access to the exit.
 - make it a sort of prison/cave maze thing that sequentially releases imps, cacos etc. into a central arena...
  - make DECORATE thing that is not visible but blocks to X height.
  
   - monster closets to targets on 3d floor: test!!
   - switch behind gore room to lower bars for plasma gun (2nd circle, north.)	OK
   - rocket is secret!!!
   
   
   - make a decorate thing for a blood drip???
   
   - don't want to back into the teleport for blue door too soon. Alter where it is...	OK
   - fix tex in outer circle				OK		
 - add light amplifier(s)?
- - missing lower instant in lower cave 	OK

3rd circle = iron rooms with rock outside and visible - like a stongbox constructed in a cave

 - baron support doesn't lower												OK
 - lava doesn't hurt under floor											OK
	- need suit nearby...													OK
	


 - do line_setblocking logic for secret tunnel at top of lava lake			OK, reworked.
 - also, do line_horizon switch on crossing a line...


TODO:
-----
 - debug sector portal in pipe (probably mismatched args)					OK (no ceiling flat...)
 - 3rd ring steps - retexture the pillar									OK
 - 3rd ring: south east inner lava cannot get out							OK
 - circle 4 switch doesn't work?											Actually, it does.
 - l4 - move fire away from doors											OK
 - put another rad suit in last room										OK
 - 3rd ring lava - add flowing to flats, speed up textures					

 - monsters in island														OK - embellish?
 - monster closets on returning to exit?
 - make secret pipe narrow at end?
 - check access to all skull tunnels:
		counting r to l
		5 (top step too high)
		9 (can't get out top - move steps back a bit)
 
 
 - blood metal texture on remotely opened barriers							OK new texture!!
 
 
 RECOVERY:
 ---------
 OK
 
 rework exit logic to be:
 
 - caverns switch opens the iron corridor, NOT the exit dropper.
 - spawn monsters in iron corridor ONCE ENTERING IT
 - have exit lowering switch visible at end. 
 - THIS switch lowers the exit platform
 - reorganize teleports to be more logical. Possbly add more.
 
MONSTERS:
---------
TODO:
closets and trigger lines... 
inner ring escape steps in lava!!!!
 
EXIT SEQUENCE:
--------------
1: 		teleport to outer ring
2: 		find red key. get fucked by lost souls...
3: 		enter second ring via W keyed door
4: 		get blue key from under broken lava floor
5: 		enter mine, ring 3, via blue keyed door, S.
6: 		fight through ring 3 upper/lower walkways, 
7: 		enter barons lair in centre
8: 		switch will open Iron Corridor on island
8.1:	do I add a teleport here that becomes availabe as well?
9:		return to island
9.1: 	need to trigger monstere closet to spawn into ring 1 (? maybe...) and island.
10:		activate switch in iron corridor to lower exit platform
10.1:	return to outer ring (maybe open another teleport???)
11:		hopefully you noticed the exit teleport...

TODO!:
fix exit 3D floor (look at backup)							OK
 - this seems to be an actual bug.					
 57 is actually the CONTROL sector!!!!!

sneaky exit from broken section goes up too far

transfer floorlight:
27, 28, 34, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 44, 47, 48

block bruiser demon from teleporting!
